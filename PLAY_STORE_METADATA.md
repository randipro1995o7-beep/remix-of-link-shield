## Full Description (4000 characters max)

**Link Guardian helps you pause and think before opening links.**

In a world of quick taps and instant clicks, Link Guardian adds a simple but powerful step: a moment to consider.

When you receive a link from messages, emails, or social media, Link Guardian gently pauses and shows you:
• Where the link is going
• Some things to consider about the website
• A recommendation based on what we noticed
